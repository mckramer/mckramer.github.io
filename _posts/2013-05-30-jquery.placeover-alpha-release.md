Today marks the official alpha release of jQuery.placeover (v0.1.0).  It is a brand new plugin for jQuery to simulate HTML5 placeholders in legacy browsers, but you can also use it with current browsers if you are crazy.

It was inspired by the OverText plugin for MooTools, but makes an effort to replicate the HTML5 placeholder handling of modern browsers.  It places a span element over the input field.  There are included suggested styles to ensure the text is not selectable and matches color of native placeholder text.

Getting started with it is as easy as one line:

{% highlight javascript %}
$('input').placeover();
{% endhighlight %}
